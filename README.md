# Formula_1



## Flutter Mobile App

## Context
Over the years, Fomula 1 has taken on a global dimension and is, along with the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, one of the most widely televised sporting events.

In the following exercise, we aim to develop a mobile application that allows users, once the application is launched, to create an account and view the ranking of Formula 1 drivers by displaying the details of each of them.

## Screens of the Application
